notes from https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/ssh-remote-control-raspberry-pi/

surprisingly, only 1 of my three monitors has HDMI 
AND that montior is the biggest one (my fave), so
I don't wanna have to use it for interacting w/ my pi
I'll SSH in! I should figure out VNC ... apparently that's a a visual way of doing this!

ssh is secure shell. the A+ test forced me to memorize that it's port 22 ;)
ssh is better than oldschool telnet cause passwords are not sent as plain text in ssh!

raspberry pi has ssh disabled by default, so it needs to be enabled
Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration
select interfaces and pick enabled for SSH
==========================================
linux and mac have ssh capability as a default, but windows is a little behind here
you have to install PuTTY to log in ... my main system (the one with trhee moniotrs!) is win10, so I'm gonan use PuTTY

port will be 22 for ssh, but what is my raspberry pi's ip address? I'd usually 
use ifconfig here, but I just learned hostname -I as a more direct route!

```console
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ hostname -I
192.168.1.3 192.168.1.4
```
^WHATTTT? Why two ip addresses? I  ran ifconfig and realized that wlan is 192.168.1.4 and etho0 is 192.168.1.3

my raspberry pi ip address is: host hossaasdf
^ use that in PuTTY
