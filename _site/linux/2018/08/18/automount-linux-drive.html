    <p>I recently broke, and then fixed, my <a href="/troubleshooting/2018/08/16/swap-not-available.html">Linux Swap File partition</a>. It wasn’t enough to create a new Swap File in Gparted. I also needed to edit the file located at /etc/fstab. ‘fstab’ isn’t a directory; it’s a filename that doesn’t seem to have an extension. From what I understand, it automatically mounts all partitions within the file.</p>

<p>Fixing my Swap File reminded me of a problem that I’ve been having with another partition. I save all of my coding projects on another drive called ‘Linux’ and that has never automatically mounted. It’s a minor annoyance to try and cd into a place that isn’t there <em>every single time</em> that I boot up my computer. In the picture below, the top terminal window is me trying to cd into the drive that isn’t mounted yet. The bottom window is successfully cd-ing into the partition <em>after</em> I opened the folder with my mouse.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/linux-automount-drive/cd_after_mount.jpg" alt="does not automount" /></p>

<p>I don’t like having to click the drive open with my mouse all the time, so I wondered if I could have it automount just like the Swap File. I found a StackExchange post that described <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/154180/how-to-mount-a-new-drive-on-startup">how to mount a drive on startup</a> and decided to give it a try. I needed to get the drive name with the ‘fdisk’ command and then change my ‘/etc/fstab’ file to reflect that drive that I wanted to automount. As usual, my first attempt with a new command failed because I didn’t use the right context:</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">fdisk -l
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">fdisk -l
fdisk: cannot open /dev/loop0: Permission denied
fdisk: cannot open /dev/loop1: Permission denied

fdisk: cannot open /dev/loop11: Permission denied
fdisk: cannot open /dev/loop12: Permission denied
fdisk: cannot open /dev/loop13: Permission denied
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>I attempted to look at the drives with my basic permissions, so it blocked me. Using sudo is required to see this information:</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">sudo fdisk -l
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>I’ve selected the important portion of the output:</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">Disk /dev/sda: 111.8 GiB, 120034123776 bytes, 234441648 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

Disk identifier: 0x151779ce

Device     Boot Start       End   Sectors   Size Id Type
/dev/sda1        2048 234438655 234436608 111.8G 83 Linux
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>One of the earlier commenters on the StackExchange article suggested to use the disk name, which would be ‘/dev/sda1’ in my case. However, I remembered how a UUID was required for adding my Swap File, so I kept reading. Apparently you can specify the drive with the disk name or the UUID. I opted to use UUID, but I imagine I’d have the same results if I used disk name. The ‘blkid’ command is required to get UUID information.</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">sudo blkid
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Here’s the relevant output:</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">/dev/sda1: LABEL="Linux" UUID="363ce6d2-4ee3-4b3c-94cd-9d6c0cc0d816" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="151779ce-01"
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>I then opened the fstab file:</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">cd /etc
sudo vi fstab
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>I’ve decided to copy over the file to have the text here. But, I couldn’t figure out how to get copy and paste to work within the vi editor, so I decided to copy and paste the fstab file (it seems that I can’t get access to copy the file … I think playing with sudo might fix this, but I’m already wanting to move on). So, going off on a bit of a tangent, here’s how I copied the fstab file:</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">cd /etc
cp fstab /media/david/Linux/
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Here’s an image of the file (so I can get more practice writing in Markdown):
<img src="/assets/linux-automount-drive/fstab.jpg" alt="fstab" />
And here’s the updated fstab file:</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">#</span><span class="w"> </span>/etc/fstab: static file system information.

</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Look at that last line (the one with a mount point of /media/david/Linux). That’s the new line that I changed in an attempt to get automount to work. I’ve read that you can do serious damage to your system by changing fstab, so I carefully read over my chosen syntax a few times before saving … hahaha, I don’t wanna get lost in another new cycle of spending hours to fix Linux again!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/linux-automount-drive/drive_now_automounts.jpg" alt="automount works" /></p>

<p>It worked! After saving fstab and restarting, I attempted to cd into the partition and I had no problems! Hooray! I’m learning more about Linux <em>and</em> I will now be saving a few extra seconds on each bootup because I don’t need to use my mouse to click open the drive!</p>
